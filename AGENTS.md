## Project

Tinycast is a native macOS menu-bar launcher (a minimal Raycast): fuzzy app launcher, global +
per-app hotkeys, a text/image clipboard history, an inline calculator, and an emoji picker. SwiftUI +
AppKit, runs as an accessory (no Dock icon, `LSUIElement`). Targets **macOS 26+** (Liquid Glass) and
builds with the **Xcode 26** toolchain.

- **Build:** XcodeGen owns the project — `Tinycast.xcodeproj` is committed but generated from
  `project.yml`. After editing `project.yml`, run `xcodegen generate` and commit. There is **no**
  `Package.swift` / SwiftPM. Full build/test/sign/release steps: [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md),
  [`docs/signing.md`](docs/signing.md).
- **Channels:** Debug builds are their own channel — `Tinycast Dev.app` / `com.tinycast.app.dev` — so a
  local run never shares prefs, caches, TCC grants or login item with an installed stable/beta.
  Anything newly persisted must stay keyed by `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier`.
- **Tests:** no XCTest target — standalone `swiftc` harnesses in `Tools/` (see Critical Invariants and
  `docs/development.md`).

## Project Philosophy

- Production-quality, as if written by a senior macOS engineer.
- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over clever ones; preserve existing behavior unless the task
  changes it.
- Keep SwiftUI views declarative and lightweight; business logic lives in models / managers.
- Respect Swift 6 actor isolation; keep expensive work off the main actor.
- Remove dead code rather than adding compatibility layers. Leave the codebase cleaner than you found
  it.
- **Comments are single-line** — no stacked / multi-line blocks. Only comment the non-obvious (a
  _why_, a gotcha, a load-bearing invariant); never restate the code.

## Architecture

Full detail: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

- **Single-owner core.** `AppCore.shared` (`Core/AppCore.swift`) is a `@MainActor` singleton owning
  every long-lived manager and the window controllers.
  `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching` calls `AppCore.shared.start()` and nothing else — that
  is the one wiring point. Palette / paste / launch actions are methods on `AppCore` that views call.
- **Mostly AppKit windows.** `TinycastApp` (`@main`) declares only a `MenuBarExtra` scene. The command
  palette is a borderless floating `NSPanel` hosting SwiftUI; Settings/About are plain `NSWindow`s via
  `AuxWindowController`. SwiftUI `Settings` / `Window` scenes are deliberately avoided (unreliable for
  accessory apps).

## Critical Invariants

Never break these without an explicit task to do so.

- **`AppCore` is the sole owner.** New long-lived state belongs on `AppCore`, wired in `start()`; don't
  create competing singletons or wire managers elsewhere.
- **`PaletteWindowController` solely owns the palette frame.** The hosting view sets
  `sizingOptions = []` so SwiftUI never drives the window size — otherwise the top edge drifts on the
  compact↔expanded swap.
- **The app is locked to `.darkAqua` globally.** The Liquid Glass material is tuned for a dark surface
  only; do not add light-mode styling.
- **The flat `selection` index must match the visible row order exactly**, including the inline
  calculator card at index 0 when present. Selection is the single source of truth for highlight /
  activation.
- **`AppEntry.Kind` is the only thing that says what an entry is.** One case per launcher section, per
  `VisibilityStore` category and per Settings pane — never re-derive a category by sniffing an entry ID
  (that's what `isCustomCommand` used to do). A new category means a new case, a slice in
  `AppIndex.publishEntries()`, and the matching filter in `LauncherList.rows`, in that same order.
- **While a footer menu is open the palette search field never resigns first responder** — input is
  frozen instead (resigning shifts the text a point or two). See [palette.md](docs/palette.md).
- **Emacs chords are read from the system tables, never matched by key code.** macOS already maps
  `⌃A ⌃E ⌃F ⌃B ⌃N ⌃P ⌃D ⌃H ⌃K ⌃Y ⌃T` in AppKit's `StandardKeyBinding.dict` (user-overridable via
  `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`), and the field editor behind the search field
  already honors all of it — so text editing needs no code and must be left alone.
  `KeyBindingResolver` closes the one gap: it resolves an event to its selector through a detached
  `NSTextView` probe, and `PalettePanel.sendEvent` rewrites **only** `moveUp:` / `moveDown:` /
  `moveForward:` / `moveBackward:` into the equivalent arrow key before anything else sees the event.
  ⌃N *is* ↓ — one handler, so compact expansion, menu nav and the emoji grid come free. A fifth
  selector means breaking working text editing; a key-code match means breaking the user's own
  rebindings. See [palette.md](docs/palette.md).
- **Focus restoration is load-bearing.** Paste targets the recorded `previousApp` and requires the
  Accessibility permission (`Permissions.ensureAccessibility()`). See [palette.md](docs/palette.md).
- **`Core/Calculator/` (incl. `CalcDateTime`) must stay Foundation-only *and pure*** — no AppKit /
  SwiftUI imports, no clock or network reads. `Tools/calc-test.swift` compiles the real engine
  sources. Both externally-sourced inputs are injected: the clock via `now`/`calendar`, the FX table
  via `rates` (`CurrencyRateStore` owns the fetch). Likewise `Core/Emoji/`
  (`EmojiCatalog`, `EmojiGridGeometry`) stays AppKit/SwiftUI-free for `Tools/emoji-test.swift`, and
  `Core/ClipboardStore.swift` must keep to Foundation + SQLite3 with no other app source, so
  `Tools/clipboard-test.swift` can compile it standalone. `Core/LauncherRankingStore.swift` is the
  same deal for `Tools/ranking-test.swift` — Foundation only, with the clock injected via `now` and
  the store path via `fileURL`, as is `Core/SearchScopes.swift` for `Tools/scopes-test.swift`.
  `Core/CustomCommand.swift` and `Core/ShellCommandRunner.swift` must likewise stay free of AppKit /
  SwiftUI (Foundation plus Combine for `ObservableObject` and Darwin for `mkstemp`) so
  `Tools/custom-command-test.swift` can compile them standalone — which is why the custom-command
  confirmation gate lives in `AppCore` and not in the runner. All of `Core/Snippets/` compiles into
  `Tools/snippets-test.swift` (the harness globs the directory), so the model, Markdown serializer,
  template engine, repository and keyword policies stay Foundation-only, and the AppKit files there
  keep their dependencies to what the harness can stub. `Core/SystemAction.swift` is also
  Foundation-only for `Tools/system-action-test.swift`; platform effects belong in
  `SystemActionRunner`, while confirmation and failure UI remain in `AppCore`.
  `Core/VolumeLevel.swift` is the same split for `Tools/volume-test.swift` — the 5% step grid and the
  percentage string are pure Foundation, CoreAudio lives in `SystemActionRunner` and observation in
  `VolumeState`, so both the HUD and the Set Volume slider walk one tested grid. `Core/WindowManagement/`
  splits the same way for `Tools/window-command-test.swift`: `WindowCommand.swift`, `WindowLayout.swift`
  and `WindowActionMemory.swift` stay Foundation + CoreGraphics and pure (no AX, no `NSScreen`, no
  clock — `WindowActionMemory` takes `now` as a parameter), while every `AXUIElement` call and the
  Cocoa↔AX coordinate flip live in `WindowMover.swift`.
- **`WindowLayout` works exclusively in AX space** — global coordinates, top-left origin, +Y **down**.
  `WindowMover.AXGeometry` is the only place that converts, and it anchors the flip on the **primary**
  display's height, never the window's own screen: doing otherwise shears every rect on a
  differently-sized display by the height difference, which is invisible on one monitor and wrong on
  every mixed-size setup. The visible consequence is that "Top Half" has `minY == visibleFrame.minY`;
  `Tools/window-command-test.swift` asserts it. Nothing in this feature ever touches
  `backingScaleFactor` — all three of `NSScreen.frame`, `visibleFrame` and AX coordinates are in points,
  so mixed-DPI correctness is automatic. See [window-management.md](docs/window-management.md).
- **Uninstall moves to the Trash and never deletes.** `FileManager.trashItem` is the only removal
  call in the feature; `removeItem` must never appear there. That is what makes display-name
  attribution tolerable — a false positive costs a drag back, not the user's data — so a
  "delete permanently" option would have to drop name matching in the same commit. The deciding half
  (`UninstallTarget.swift`, `UninstallSearchRoot.swift`, `UninstallRules.swift`,
  `UninstallProtection.swift`, `UninstallPlan.swift`) stays Foundation-only and pure for
  `Tools/uninstall-test.swift`, with every environment fact injected: the scanner hands the rules
  directory **names**, never URLs, and hands the classifier a `PathFacts`. Every `FileManager`,
  `lstat` and Full Disk Access read lives in `UninstallScanner`, which **detects** FDA (a silent,
  promptless probe) and never requests it — this feature asks for no permission and never escalates
  privilege. `tccRelativePrefixes` is **measured, not assumed**: probe a location by creating and
  trashing a throwaway directory there before adding it, because *listing* is not the test —
  `~/Library/Containers` enumerates fine and still refuses the move, while
  `~/Library/Application Scripts` allows it. A locked candidate can never enter the checked set; that invariant lives in
  `UninstallSelection`'s one intersection, not in the view. Tinycast also refuses to plan its own
  uninstall, compared against the **running** identity so the Dev channel refuses itself too.
  See [uninstall.md](docs/uninstall.md).
- **Quicklinks are authored data, and their store never deletes.** `Core/Quicklinks/` splits like
  `Core/Uninstall/`: `Quicklink.swift`, `QuicklinkDestination.swift`, `QuicklinkStore.swift` and
  `QuicklinkArchive.swift` stay Foundation-only (plus SQLite3) and pure for
  `Tools/quicklink-test.swift` — the home directory is injected, never read — while `QuicklinkLauncher`
  owns every `NSWorkspace` call and `QuicklinkArgumentSession` the prompt state. The database lives in
  **Application Support**, not Caches, and a database that won't open is **reported, never discarded**:
  `ClipboardStore`'s delete-and-recreate is only sound because history is regenerable, and a link
  library is not. `Quicklink.precedes` is the one display order, sorted through by both the store and
  the `AppIndex` slice. There is **one template engine**: quicklinks expand through
  `SnippetTemplateEngine` rather than a second parser, which is what makes `| raw` mean something —
  it opts a value out of the automatic percent-encoding a URL destination asks for. `{selectedText}`
  is accepted as an alias for `{selection}`, but nothing ever *writes* it. See
  [quicklinks.md](docs/quicklinks.md).
- **`Core/SearchRelevance.swift` is Foundation-only and pure**, so `Tools/fuzz-test.swift` compiles
  the shipped scorer rather than a copy of it. It owns both `FuzzyMatch` (the tiered
  exact/prefix/word-start/substring/subsequence scorer) and the field bands. **Searchable fields stay
  separate** — display name, Spotlight alternate names, bundle id, executable name are never flattened
  into one string, because the field is what picks the band. Bands are one `bandStride` apart, an
  order of magnitude above `FuzzyMatch.maximumScore` and two above `LauncherRankingStore`'s boost cap:
  that gap is what keeps a learned boost reordering *within* a tier and never across a tier or a
  field. A new searchable field means a new `Band` case and a `consider` call, in priority order.
- **`EmojiData.generated.swift` is emitted by `node Tools/gen-emoji.js` and
  `CurrencyData.generated.swift` by `node Tools/gen-currencies.js`** — never edit either by hand.
  Currency names, signs and uncontested nouns are generated (Frankfurter × CLDR); the only
  hand-maintained currency data is `CalcCurrency.contested`, the nouns several currencies share
  (`dollars`, `pounds`). Don't add slang or synonyms there — no source of truth, so they rot.
- **Every networked feature ships off and is consent-gated.** Tinycast is offline by default; a
  feature that reaches the network must be opt-in behind a Settings toggle whose dialog names the
  provider, the cadence and what leaves the machine, and its owning store must re-check consent at
  every entry point — including on both sides of the `await` around the request, since consent can
  be withdrawn mid-flight. Consent flags live on the owning store, never in `AppSettings`
  (`SettingsBackup` mirrors that type, and an import must not grant network access). Model the gate
  so the *safe* state is the default: `CalcEngine.evaluate`'s `currency:` parameter defaults to
  `.off`, so forgetting to pass one disables the feature rather than enabling it. Fetch on a private
  **cacheless** `URLSession` (`.ephemeral`, `urlCache = nil`), never `URLSession.shared` — a cacheable
  response would leave a second copy in the on-disk `URLCache` that opting out doesn't delete.
  `CurrencyRateStore` is the reference implementation — follow it rather than inventing a second shape.
- **Snippets are channel-isolated and path-identified.** Persist them under
  `~/Library/Application Support/<bundle-id>/Snippets/`; `StoredSnippet.ID` is the standardized source
  path, and external rename is delete + create. The feature ships off and its enable switch doubles as
  keyword-expansion consent: `snippetsEnabled` is excluded from settings backups, and Accessibility —
  the only permission, since the listen-only tap needs nothing more — may be requested only from that
  explicit Settings gesture, never from startup, callbacks, watchers or health checks.
  See [snippets.md](docs/snippets.md).
- **The two Raycast export formats share no mapper.** `RaycastFormat.detect` is the *only* branch
  between them; `RaycastImportV1` and `RaycastImportV2` own their own decrypt and their own field
  mapping, and neither is ever tried as a fallback for the other (that is what makes a wrong
  passphrase report a wrong passphrase instead of "not a Raycast export"). They meet only at
  `RaycastImport.Result`. `RaycastFormat.swift` and `RaycastV1Decoder.swift` stay Foundation +
  CommonCrypto + Carbon so `Tools/raycast-test.swift` compiles them standalone, which is why the
  decoder returns Raycast's own values and `RaycastImportV1` — not the decoder — validates them
  against `PopToRootTimeout` / `EmojiSkinTone` / `HyperKeyPhysicalKey` / `KeyShortcut`. Never commit a
  real `.rayconfig` as a fixture: the harness builds its own. See
  [raycast-import.md](docs/raycast-import.md).
- **Swift 6 language mode: data-race violations are hard errors.** Almost everything is `@MainActor`;
  cross-actor model types are `Sendable`; heavy / IO work (app scan, image decode) is pushed off-main
  via `Task.detached` / `nonisolated`. Keep that boundary. House idioms: `NotificationToken` (RAII) for
  block observers, `isolated deinit` for `ClipboardStore`'s SQLite teardown, decode raw Carbon / C
  pointers to plain values before crossing into actor code.
- **Clipboard writes stamp a private `internalType` marker** so the poller skips Tinycast's own writes.
- **Hotkeys persist under legacy `KeyboardShortcuts_<name>` UserDefaults keys** (from the removed
  KeyboardShortcuts package) so old bindings survive. `HotKeyBinding` is the one thing an action is
  bound to and it has two cases with two engines: a `.combo` is a Carbon registration, a `.doubleTap`
  is recognized by `DoubleTapMonitor` (Carbon cannot see a lone modifier at all). Its `Codable`
  conformance is the compatibility seam — a `.combo` must keep encoding as the bare
  `{"carbonKeyCode":N,"carbonModifiers":N}` record and decoding must keep trying that shape first, or
  every existing binding and backup breaks. `Core/HotKey/DoubleTapModifier.swift` and
  `DoubleTapDetector.swift` stay Foundation-only and pure with the clock injected as a parameter, for
  `Tools/hotkey-test.swift`; every `CGEvent` call lives in `DoubleTapMonitor.swift`, which is
  listen-only, installs *only* while something is bound to a double-tap, and never prompts for
  Accessibility. See [hotkeys.md](docs/hotkeys.md).
- **Tinycast presents its own dialogs, never `NSAlert` / `NSSlider` / system popovers.** Every
  confirmation, failure report and value prompt goes through `DialogController` (`Core/Dialog/`,
  owned by `AppCore`; reachable elsewhere via `AppCore.showNotice` / `confirm`). Presentation is
  `async`, so there is no nested run loop, and the presenter refuses a second dialog while one is up
  — that, not a flag, is what stops a held hotkey stacking dialogs. **↵ runs the primary action,
  Escape cancels, and Cancel always renders leading** (the left button), matching macOS convention.
- **A dialog has three independent axes; never let one infer another.** The **icon**
  (`DialogRequest.symbol`, required) is always the *subject's* own glyph — the command being
  confirmed uses its `SystemAction.sfSymbol`, so the Restart dialog shows the same icon as the
  Restart row. Tone never picks an icon. The **tone** (`DialogTone`: `.neutral` / `.success` /
  `.danger`) tints only that glyph. The **button** takes its color from `DialogAction.Role`
  (`.standard` white / `.destructive` red / `.cancel` secondary), so a red-glyph security warning can
  still carry a plain white button — as "Import executable commands?" does. Resolve every glyph
  through `SymbolImage`, not `Image(systemName:)`: some catalog symbols are bundled assets
  (`toggleBluetooth`). A button never prints its key cap; hovering it shows a `Tooltip`
  (`Core/Tooltip.swift`) instead, styled like the palette's own keycap chips.
- **A transient readout is a HUD, not a dialog.** `VolumeHUDController`'s box is volume/mute only,
  since that one needs an actual level and number; every other success/info confirmation (system
  commands, Custom Commands, Snippets) goes through `MessageHUDController`'s pill, whose trailing
  glyph *is* its `DialogTone` — a pill has no subject to name, so the dialogs' icon rule doesn't
  apply, and the mapping stays file-scoped so nothing can reach for it when building a
  `DialogRequest`. Both are driven by `HUDPresenter`, which owns the one-at-a-time / auto-dismiss /
  fade policy; a new HUD means a new presenter, not a second shape bolted onto an existing
  controller. See [ui.md](docs/ui.md#dialogs--hud).
- **Glass is for controls; content takes the panel recipe.** `glassEffect` needs a backdrop to lens,
  so it only works *inside* a window that already has a `VisualEffectView` — the action capsule, the
  menu circle, `PopoverMenu`, a dialog's buttons. On a bare borderless panel it falls back to an
  opaque backing and shows as a dark edge. Both HUDs therefore use `black panelDimming` →
  `VisualEffectView()` → `clipShape`, exactly like a dialog.
- **Read [`docs/ui.md`](docs/ui.md) before any restyle or new view.** `Core/Theme.swift` is the single
  design-token source.
- **`Core/EdgeDissolve.swift` and `Core/ThinScrollbar.swift` are off-limits.** Both are tuned by eye
  against the palette's floating bars, so any edit is a visual regression. Do not touch them to fix a
  scroll bug, and never as a side effect of a restyle or refactor — needing to is the signal that the
  real fix belongs elsewhere (a scroll target, an inset, an intent). Edit either one only under an
  explicit task to change that look.

## Project Layout

- `Tinycast/Core/` — managers, stores, windows, AppKit glue (no view bodies beyond hosting).
  `Core/Calculator/` and `Core/Emoji/` are Foundation-only engines; `Core/Snippets/` is a
  standalone-harness input in full (and owns the template engine both it and Quicklinks expand
  through); `Core/WindowManagement/` is a pure geometry layer plus its one AX file; `Core/Uninstall/`
  splits the same way — five pure files, one scanner, one Trash runner; `Core/Quicklinks/` is four
  pure files plus the opener and the argument session;
  `Core/Theme.swift` is the design-token source; `Core/HotKey/` is the in-house hotkey stack.
- `Tinycast/Features/` — SwiftUI views: `RootPaletteView`, `Launcher/`, `Clipboard/`, `Calculator/`,
  `Emoji/`, `Quicklinks/`, `Uninstall/`, `Settings/`, `About/`, `Onboarding/`, plus shared
  `PopoverMenu`. Each
  `SettingsTab` maps to
  one `…SettingsView` built on the `SettingsPane` / `SettingsCard` scaffold in `SettingsComponents.swift`;
  the four launcher-category panes (Applications, System Settings, System Actions, Commands) are thin
  wrappers over the shared `LauncherItemsCard`.
- `Tinycast/App/` — `@main` app + delegate.
- `Tools/` — standalone test harnesses and the emoji generator.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — the entire release pipeline (see `docs/development.md`).
