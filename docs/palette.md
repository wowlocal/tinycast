# Palette

The command palette is a borderless floating `NSPanel` hosting SwiftUI; see
[architecture.md](architecture.md) for window ownership.

## State flow

`PaletteViewModel` (mode / query / selection / `focusToken`) is the bridge between the panel and
`AppCore`. Showing the palette calls `prepare(mode:)`, which resets state and bumps `focusToken` (a
UUID) so the SwiftUI search field re-focuses. `RootPaletteView` switches its content on `mode`:

- `.launcher` → `LauncherList`
- `.clipboard` → `ClipboardList` + preview
- `.calculatorHistory` → `CalculatorHistoryList`
- `.uninstall` → `UninstallList` (see [uninstall.md](uninstall.md))
- `.quicklinks` → `QuicklinkList`
- `.quicklinkArguments` → `QuicklinkArgumentsView` (see [quicklinks.md](quicklinks.md#the-argument-prompt))

Clipboard and Calculator History are sub-screens reached from the launcher (Tab, a command, or a
hotkey) and back out to it. Uninstall is one too, but reached only from a launcher app's Actions menu
and scoped to that app; like Calculator History it stays out of the Tab cycle. So do both Quicklinks
screens.

The argument screen is the one mode where the search field is not a search field: it *is* the current
argument's input, so its placeholder names that argument and ↵ submits rather than activating a row.
Its own state lives on `AppCore.quicklinkArguments`, the way `.uninstall`'s target lives on
`UninstallSession`, and leaving the mode cancels the pending open. A bare backspace steps back an
argument before it falls through to the usual exit-to-launcher.

The flat `selection` index is the single source of truth for highlight / activation and **must always
match the visible row order**, including the inline calculator card at index 0 when present (see
[calculator.md](calculator.md)).

## Window placement

`PaletteWindowController` resolves an anchor (left edge + top edge) **once per summon** and reuses it
for every compact↔expanded resize, so only the height changes and the top edge never drifts. The
anchor is dropped on hide, so the next summon re-resolves for wherever the user is then.

Which display it anchors to depends on the **Follow the cursor across displays** setting
(`AppSettings.openOnCursorScreen`, on by default):

- **On** — the screen holding `NSEvent.mouseLocation`, i.e. the display under the pointer.
- **Off** — `NSScreen.main`.

`NSScreen.main` alone can't implement the follow-the-cursor case: it is documented as the *key window's*
screen, and an accessory app driving a non-activating panel has no key window on the display the user is
looking at, so `main` resolves to the menu-bar display regardless of where the pointer is.

The hit test is `NSMouseInRect(mouse, screen.frame, false)`, **not** `CGRect.contains`. A mouse location
is the CoreGraphics cursor position flipped about the primary display's height, so a screen's rows land
in the half-open interval `(minY, maxY]`: the topmost row is exactly `maxY`, which `contains` excludes,
while that same value is the `minY` of the display stacked above. `contains` would therefore hand a
pointer parked at the top of one display to its neighbour. `NSMouseInRect` exists for precisely this.

## Emacs key bindings

macOS already ships the Emacs chords. AppKit's `StandardKeyBinding.dict` maps `⌃A ⌃E ⌃F ⌃B ⌃N ⌃P
⌃D ⌃H ⌃K ⌃Y ⌃T ⌃O ⌃V` to `NSStandardKeyBindingResponding` selectors, the user may override any of
them in `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`, and the field editor behind the SwiftUI
`TextField` resolves the whole table for free. **Most of this feature is therefore nothing** — text
editing in the search field already works and must be left alone.

The one gap is movement. In a single-line field `moveUp:` / `moveDown:` are dead ends, and the
palette wants them to drive the list, not the caret. `KeyBindingResolver` closes it by reading the
binding rather than the key code:

- A detached `NSTextView` probe runs `interpretKeyEvents` and records the selector the system tables
  resolve the event into. Detached is deliberate — resolution needs no window and no first responder.
  An unbound chord comes back as `noop:`, which is what distinguishes "not bound" from "bound to
  something the palette doesn't own".
- `PalettePanel.sendEvent` rewrites the four movement selectors into their plain arrow key **before
  anything else inspects the event**, stripping the ⌃ (a surviving one turns `→` into
  `moveToRightEndOfLine:`).

So ⌃N *is* ↓ — one handler, not two. Compact-bar expansion, menu navigation and the emoji grid all
come along, and anything added to `.onKeyPress(.downArrow)` later is inherited automatically.

Two rules keep this from spreading. **Only the four movement selectors are ever taken over**; every
other standard binding belongs to the field editor, and adding a fifth means breaking working text
editing. And **nothing here matches a key code** — the ⌃ gate exists only so ordinary typing never
reaches the probe and a bare arrow is never handled twice. That is what makes a user's own
`DefaultKeyBinding.dict` work: rebind `⌃J` to `moveDown:` and the palette follows.
`Tools/keybinding-test.swift` asserts both, and reports a local rebinding as a skip rather than a
failure.

## The placeholder is Tinycast's, not the field's

The search field is a SwiftUI `TextField` with **no `prompt`**; `RootPaletteView` draws the
placeholder itself as a leading-aligned background `Text`.

AppKit gives an `NSTextField` a field editor one point taller than the field (measured: a 24pt editor
in a 23pt field), and a `prompt` is rendered by whichever of the cell and the editor currently owns
the text. The same placeholder glyphs therefore sit **one point higher** once the field takes the
panel's shared field editor. That editor is created lazily and then cached on the window for its
lifetime, so the step was only ever visible on the first summon after launch — and only where the eye
could track it, when the outgoing and incoming placeholders share a leading word.

Drawing it in SwiftUI pins it to the layout instead: measured ink is identical in both focus states,
against a two-backing-pixel step for the real prompt. It is a **background**, not an overlay, so the
caret still draws over it, and it carries `allowsHitTesting(false)` so clicking the placeholder still
lands the caret. `PaletteMode.placeholder` is still the one source of the strings; the field takes an
explicit `accessibilityLabel` because the prompt used to supply it.

This is the same class of bug as the freeze below — both come from the cell/field-editor swap.

## Menu-open input freeze

While a footer popover menu (⌘K Actions / app menu) is open the search field reads as inert but
**never resigns first responder** — resigning makes the `NSTextField` swap between its field-editor
and cell rendering, shifting the text / placeholder a point or two, so focus stays put. Input is
frozen instead:

- `RootPaletteView` mirrors the open state into `PaletteViewModel.menuOpen`, whose `didSet` fires
  `onMenuOpenChanged`.
- `PalettePanel.sendEvent` then swallows text-editing keystrokes while `menuOpen` (letting ⌘/⌥ chords
  and menu-nav keys through to SwiftUI `onKeyPress`).
- The caret is hidden by clearing SwiftUI's **own** live field editor's `insertionPointColor`. SwiftUI
  force-casts its field editor to a private subclass, so vending a custom one crashes — only the
  existing one can be tuned.

## Focus restoration (load-bearing)

`PaletteWindowController` records `previousApp` (the frontmost app) on show. Paste then targets that
app:

- `Paster.paste` activates it and posts a synthetic ⌘V via `CGEvent`.
- `Paster.pasteInPlace` posts ⌘V straight to the app's PID _without_ activating it, so the palette can
  stay open and frontmost (used by "paste keeping window open").

Both require the Accessibility permission (`Permissions.ensureAccessibility()`).

The same show also mirrors that app into `PaletteViewModel.pasteTarget` (a `PasteTarget`: localized
name + bundle path), so Clipboard and Emoji can name it — the footer pill reads "Paste to Notes" and
the ⌘K paste rows carry the app's icon. Resolved once per summon, never per render, and deliberately
not cleared by `prepare` (pop-to-root resets the screen, not the target).
